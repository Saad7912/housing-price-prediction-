## Introduction
Predicting housing prices accurately is a significant challenge, especially with large datasets containing both numerical and categorical data. This project involves using various data preprocessing techniques, handling missing values, and creating a regression model to predict housing prices based on historical data.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash

```

Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used for this project contains information on housing sales, including features such as the number of rooms, house size, year built, and more. The target variable is the sale price of the houses.

## Data Preprocessing
Initial Data Exploration
The dataset is loaded, and initial exploration is performed:

Checking the shape and columns of the dataset
Summarizing statistics using describe()
Identifying categorical and numerical columns
Visualizing the distribution of the target variable (SalePrice)

## Handling Missing Values
Missing data was visualized using bar plots to identify columns with the most missing values.
Columns with more than 40% missing values were dropped.
For remaining columns, different imputation techniques were used:
Mean imputation for numerical columns like LotFrontage, MasVnrArea.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation for GarageYrBlt.
Mode imputation for categorical columns like BsmtFinType1, GarageType.

## Outlier Detection and Treatment
Outliers in numerical columns were detected using the IQR method and replaced with the mean value of the respective column to stabilize the data.

## Feature Engineering
Transformation of Target Variable
The target variable, SalePrice, was log-transformed to handle skewness in the distribution, improving the model's ability to generalize.

## Correlation Analysis
Pearson correlation was used to analyze relationships between numerical variables.
A heatmap was plotted to visualize the correlation matrix.

## Chi-Square and ANOVA Tests
Chi-Square tests were conducted for categorical-categorical relationships.
ANOVA tests were performed to analyze categorical-numerical relationships.
Results were visualized using heatmaps.

## Modeling
The regression model is built using TensorFlow. Various regression techniques, including linear regression and more advanced algorithms, were explored to improve the model's performance.

## Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) to assess its accuracy and generalization ability.
Visualizations of predictions vs actual values were created to better understand the model's behavior.
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of predicting housing prices using regression, with a focus on data preprocessing and feature engineering. The final model provides a good balance between accuracy and interpretability.
